This research aims to enhance New L.oak's marketing strategy for customer acquisition. They face challenges with brand awareness, primarily relying on word-of-mouth marketing. Additionally, due to their product and business model, they lack repeat customers. Moreover, there's a need for a consistent brand identity across social media platforms. Our task is to devise a strategy to engage potential clients effectively, differentiate New L.oak from competitors, elevate their brand reputation, and boost brand awareness while gaining customer insights.
