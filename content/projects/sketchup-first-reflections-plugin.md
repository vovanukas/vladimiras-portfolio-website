SketchUp Ray Tracing Plugin that simulates ray reflections in a 3D environment. The plugin allows users to visualize sound reflections by casting rays from a selected surface within SketchUp models. It is designed to assist in architectural acoustic design by providing a quick and easy way to simulate sound-wave behavior in various environments.
