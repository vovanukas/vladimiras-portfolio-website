# Executive Summary
### Introduction and Objectives
This assignment focuses on testing the AV promotional production for the Royal Delft Museum video on the target group in order to find out if it inspires them to attend the upcoming Picasso ceramics exhibition. The client’s annual report from 2021 says that they had 142 thousand visitors that year, but only 20% of them were living in the Netherlands (Royal Delft Museum, 2022). This means that the Royal Delft isn’t attracting the residents of The Netherlands that have a museum membership. The Royal Delft Museum’s goal is to attract more museumkaart holders to the exclusive Picasso exhibition that only they will be holding in the Netherlands. To achieve this they reached out to us for help making the promotional video. The goal of this field research is to find out if the video we created suits the wants and needs of museumkaart holders and to figure out how it can be improved in the final product by interviewing them.

### Challenges and Strategic Promotion

There are currently 1.3 million museum card holders (Amsterdam Tips, 2023) and despite the free entrance for museumkaart holders and the number of them in the country, that hasn’t influenced the number of visitors to Royal Delft Museum (Royal Delft Museum, 2022). Furthermore, the museum's management believes the upcoming Picasso exhibit is the perfect opportunity to bring awareness about the museum (Berg, 2023). By creating an advertisement that showcases the museum and Picasso ceramics in a creative, not overly informational way and highlighting that museumkaart holders can visit for free the expectation is to attract more people to visit the exhibit. In the end, the goal is to receive more visitors for the exhibit and retain them as regulars in the future.

### Research Insights and Video Enhancement

From previously done desk and field research it is known that the interviewed target group members haven’t visited the Royal Delft museum and hadn’t known that Picasso had made ceramics which is why the created AV promotional video emphasizes these facts and showcases both the museum and ceramics (Baranauskaite, 2023).
