### Moving to the Netherlands

In 2023, I relocated to the Netherlands to pursue a degree in International Creative Business at Hogeschool Inholland and enhance my skills in event management and marketing.I worked as an Events Organizer and Student Assistant for ASA Campus in The Hague. During this role, I planned and hosted an event for approximately 140 attendees, managing all aspects from marketing to on-the-day coordination. The position required meticulous planning and creative problem-solving to ensure the event's success.
