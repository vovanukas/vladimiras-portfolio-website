### Programming Audio Into Games

During my internship year at Coventry University I have worked with an audio post-production boutique, Auris Media.

During my time with them I have created high-quality sound assets using Nuendo and integrated into Unreal Engine 5 through Wwise middleware, enhancing the immersive qualities of interactive media projects.

Showcased my strong skills in audio programming by developing, optimizing, and debugging efficient audio systems.

Collaborated with multidisciplinary teams, providing creative solutions for audio-related project needs.
