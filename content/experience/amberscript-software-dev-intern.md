### Interning With a Successful SaaS Start Up

At Amberscript, I took ownership over many projects to make everyday business operations more efficient.

Using automations tools such as UI Bakery, JavaScript and Google Apps Script I have successfully crafted systems to ensure speedy freelancer management and payout processes for the finance and operations team.

Using webhooks, UI Bakery Automations and Slack + other various APIs, I have created a helper Slack bot, which allowed the use of commands to quickly acomplish everyday actions for all employees.

Finally, with React and Java, I have had the opportunity to work on customer facing transcriber platform, delivering quality of life changes to our freelancers and users.
