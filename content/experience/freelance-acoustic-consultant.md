### Launching My Own Programming School

After being laid off, I have bootstrapped and managed an online tutoring business, teaching Python to young children online.

To effectively lead online lessons I have developed a robust videoconferencing architecture to deliver online lessons, I explored and evaluated platforms such as Jitsi, Google Meet, Zoom, Microsoft Teams and BigBlueButton.

In pursuit of expanding my clientele I have conducted thorough market research and implemented A/B testing to my ads and website, maximizing user engagement and CPA.

To host online tutorails, I created the website, blog and landing page using static website generator â€“ Hugo, HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
