### Teaching Others the Joy of Programming

During my time at Coventry University, I was also working as a Coding Instructor for a London-based tutoring company, Codetoday.

During my lessons I have effectively led students in coding, and exhibited exceptional communication skills, conveying complex programming concepts in a simple and engaging manner.

To make programming accessible and enjoyable for students of all ages, I adapted my teaching style. Maintained an approachable and friendly demeanor while also commanding respect when necessary.

Committed to self-improvement, consistently sought to enhance programming knowledge and teaching methods.
