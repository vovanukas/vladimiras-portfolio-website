### Elevating Brands with Precision and Creativity

In 2022, I worked as a Product Manager in Shopper Marketing at Sorbum Group in Vilnius, Lithuania, where I was involved in the marketing and advertising of Glo, an electronic tobacco product. The role demanded both precise execution and creative thinking due to the highly regulated nature of the industry. I coordinated street teams, employed mascots, and implemented various innovative strategies to promote the product effectively.
